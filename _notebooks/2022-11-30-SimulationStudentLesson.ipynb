    "- The user created an initial configuration of cells on the grid, and presses play (tap the squares on the grid)\n",
    "- a cells's status (alive or dead, on or off) depends on the surrounding 8 cells status (surrounding 8 boxes). Here are the rules:\n",
    "    - The birth rule= a dead cell (blue box) that is surrounded by at least 3 alive cells (yellow boxes), will become alive\n",
    "    - The death rule= an alive cell (yellow) with no or only one surviving cell around it dies (becomes blue)\n",
    "    - Cell survival= an alive cell (yellow) with 2 or 3 alive neighboring cells will stay alive\n",

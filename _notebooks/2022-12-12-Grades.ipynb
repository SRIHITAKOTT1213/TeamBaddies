    "|Jeongwoo Lee | 1/1\t|Alexa Carlson | All hacks complete with very detailed explanations of simulations. 6/6 on quiz and 5 extra simulations coded |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "|Aron Rub | 0.96/1\t| Sri Kotturi | All the Hacks were complete and done very nicely and explained well. Extra credit completed and explained. I didn't see much of the guided questions being answered for the dice hack though, but overall it is good. Good Job!! |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "| Alex Kumar | 0.96/1 | Lydia Cho | All hacks complete with very detailed descriptions of each code. Basic extra simulation completed, but could have added more factors (or explained how) to make it more accurate.\t|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "| Safin Singh |\t1/1\t| Alexa Carlson\t| All hacks complete with very unique and detailed discriptions of the simulations. 6/6 on quiz. Coded a complex physics simulation that actually runs. |\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",

<tr>
<td>Aron Rub</td>
<td>0.96/1</td>
<td>Sri Kotturi</td>
<td>All the Hacks were complete and done very nicely and explained well. Extra credit completed and explained. I didn't see much of the guided questions being answered for the dice hack though, but overall it is good. Good Job!!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Alex Kumar</td>
<td>0.96/1</td>
<td>Lydia Cho</td>
<td>All hacks complete with very detailed descriptions of each code. Basic extra simulation completed, but could have added more factors (or explained how) to make it more accurate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Safin Singh</td>
<td>1/1</td>
<td>Alexa Carlson</td>
<td>All hacks complete with very unique and detailed discriptions of the simulations. 6/6 on quiz. Coded a complex physics simulation that actually runs.</td>
</tr>

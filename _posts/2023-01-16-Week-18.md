- This is a visual map of how out frontend and backend will be conneted and get/post data
    - frontend is represented by the pink boxes
    - backend is represented by the yellow boxes
    - the purple ovals describe what location/file the code is in
- 1st: User inputs data into our frontend (on workoutlog.md)
- 2nd: the input gets posted to the backend
- 3rd: the backend converts the data into JSON format (in login-workout-backend.py)
- 4th: the JASON data is autogenerated in javascript (in gendata.js) and then imported to the frontend (Workoutlog.md) 
- 5th: the input is now in the table displayed in the frontend

## Frontend Code

![Frontend Code]({{site.baseurl}}/images/BeginningStepforCrud.jpg)
- This is the code that is the beginning step for C.R.U.D. This uses html 5 input in the table, allowing people to input their workouts. Then, the input will go through our UML process (shown in the ss above).

##### CRUD
C - In our website, we are creating a login system where the user can input their information and workouts on individual tables.
R - The information inputted will go through our UML process.
U - The information, once processed, will be added to the table (such as the workout logs)
D - The user could have the option to delete on command, not when the page refreshes.

### CSS on our Home Page

![CSS Boxes]({{site.baseurl}}/images/CSSboxes.jpg)
- This is the code that uses CSS to create the boxes on our project home page. By using CSS, we are able to format aspects of the boxes like the width, height, position, etc.

## Project= a Tool to help ASB Clubs Executive:
- asb doesn't have to type everthing out/easier to check
- club leaders to update info (not ust asb changing it)
- doesn't have to go into ASB room to drop off meeting minutes (tedious/unorganized/TERRIBLE COME ON CLUBS ;) )

### Admin pages:
- ASB can change everything
- only clubs with accounts can change their row

### Club Review Database:
- allows members of clubs to add reviews
- security feture: admin can delete reviews
- each club can have many reviews

## Their Presentation:
- this group did a great job with their presentation
- used canva to present
- included wireframes/UMLs (submit button = frontend -> backend)
- listed challenges
- showed a chart that showed level of acess (admin vs user)
- made a specific plan/goal of everything they wil be completing in the next 6 weeks (assigned work)
- issues/scrum board/manifesto

## Taking into Account for our Group:
- details = everything!
- ^ for example, explain the exact purpose of every page (ex: ISPE page is to help kids keep track of their workouts/grades and to ensure they get the credit for the class)
- include lots of visuals
- for example, this team included visuals on their scrum board and process, so we can show our agile manifesto and scrum board
- can make a specific plan of how we are going to accomplish our project on time

## Our Challenges (Ava)


Past challenges:
1.  Frontend:
- Our team had little knowledge of CSS and styling, so we tried new things and went through trial and error until we ended up with our current website design.
2. Backend:
- Last week's hacks were definitely a struggle when learning how to create a database for our user data and using an API to call that data from a browser.

Future Challenges:
1. Figuring out how to connect our frontend to our backend (with correct HTML5 tables)
2. preventing garbage data for all of our tables
3. figuring out how to successfully edit/delete responses from frontend
4. testing our data: making sure no garbage data,  correct errors returned for garbage, not all users get the same data (unless specified otherwise like for quotes)


## Admin vs User Access (Alexa)
- Anyone who is an Admin (Ava, Alexa, Lydia, Sri, Nikhil) can acess all users and their inputs
- Any user with a normal account will only be able to see/add/edit their own inputs on their pages

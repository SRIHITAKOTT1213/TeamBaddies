### Incorporating CRUD
- many features on this website will have the ability to recieve input
- every table will have an edit/delete option so users can update/add/delete their data

<br>
<br>

### Our Challenges/Future Tasks:
Past challenges:
1.  Frontend:
- Our team had little knowledge of CSS and styling, so we tried new things and went through trial and error until we ended up with our current website design.
2. Backend:
- Last week's hacks were definitely a struggle when learning how to create a database for our user data and using an API to call that data from a browser.

Future Challenges:
1. Figuring out how to connect our frontend to our backend (with correct HTML5 tables)
2. trying to connect the Backend to the Front End for the Login page, where the computer has to store all the login information from the registration page
3. preventing garbage data for all of our tables
4. figuring out how to successfully edit/delete responses from frontend
5. testing our data: making sure no garbage data,  correct errors returned for garbage, not all users get the same data (unless specified otherwise like for quotes)

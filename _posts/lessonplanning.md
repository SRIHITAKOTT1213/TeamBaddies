# Lesson Outline

1. Intro to simulations
    - describe what a simulation is from Collegeboard
    - how it is different from an experiment (ex. virtual vs. real life)
    - have non-binary example of simulation (rolling dice)
    - show parking lot example


## Lesson To-Do:

- [ ] Intro to a simulation <- similar to collegeboard (explain what it is and purpose/how it is different from an experiment)
- [ ] Research the development of simulations
- [ ] [Rolling dice simulation as example?](https://realpython.com/python-dice-roll/) < could be homework (more simple)
- [ ] Design a simulation of a parking lot for lesson (use binary and each parking spot is represented by a bit)
- [ ] Convert ideas into one programming language (Javascript?)
- [ ] create a hw assignment (have students develop their own simulation? Creative freedom or pre-determined simulation? Debug/correct errors in a pre-made simulation?)
- [ ] make a notes "template" in VS code (markdown) where students can fill in the blank <part of intro and in teaching development


## Simulation To-Do:

- [ ] explain notes to Sri and Ava (try to remember/make sense of notes)
- [ ] create an HTML table
- [ ] convert ideas into one programming language (javascript?)
- [ ] start code with fixed numbers (example: 7,9,2,12)
- [ ] make a for loop and nested for loop where it turns on an image (of a car) where the bit =1
- [ ] make a button that will generate 4 random numbers (random grid of cars 4x4 bits <each row is a number represented by 4 bits)
- [ ] test, test, test
- [ ] create an explanation of code + explain use of simulation (basically speaker notes for lesson)

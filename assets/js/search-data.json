Intro to simulations describe what a simulation is from Collegeboard | how it is different from an experiment (ex. virtual vs. real life) | . | Show parking lot example and explain how the binary works (include learnings from binary lesson) | Present Hacks fixing rolling dice code | create something with binary? | answer questions about simulations | fill in the blank? | . | Lesson To-Do: . Intro to a simulation &lt;- similar to collegeboard (explain what it is and purpose/how it is different from an experiment) | Research the development of simulations | Rolling dice simulation as example? &lt; could be homework (more simple) | Design a simulation of a parking lot for lesson (use binary and each parking spot is represented by a bit) | Convert ideas into one programming language (Javascript?) | create a hw assignment (have students develop their own simulation? Creative freedom or pre-determined simulation? Debug/correct errors in a pre-made simulation?) | make a notes “template” in VS code (markdown) where students can fill in the blank &lt;part of intro and in teaching development | . Simulation To-Do: . explain notes to Sri and Ava (try to remember/make sense of notes) | create an HTML table | convert ideas into one programming language (javascript?) | start code with fixed numbers (example: 7,9,2,12) | make a for loop and nested for loop where it turns on an image (of a car) where the bit =1 | make a button that will generate 4 random numbers (random grid of cars 4x4 bits &lt;each row is a number represented by 4 bits) | test, test, test | create an explanation of code + explain use of simulation (basically speaker notes for lesson) | .",

            "content": "Intro to Simulations . What is a simulation? A simulation is an imitation of a situation or process | Aka a virtual experiment | . | . Examples of Simulations: . Simulations are used all the time over many different industries . testing safety of a car | games | testing the efficiency of a parking lot | testing a new train route | . Simulation vs. Experiment . Experiment definition: procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact | . So, why use a simulation? . Advantages: Can be safer | More cost-effective | More efficient | More data in less time | . | Disadvantages: Not as accurate as experiments | outside factors not included (ex: in rolling dice simulation gravity and air resistance) | . | . leads into real life game example: . A Real Life Example . four corners game here | explain how person who chooses a corner is the random.randint | | . DEBRIEF: why is it better to code simulations than experiement in real life? . import random status = &quot;in&quot; while status != &quot;out&quot;: chooseCorner = input(&quot;What corner do you choose?&quot;) corner = random.randint(1,4) if int(chooseCorner) == corner: status = &quot;out&quot; print(&quot;You chose corner number &quot; + chooseCorner + &quot; and you&#39;re OUT&quot;) else: print(&quot;You chose corner number &quot; + chooseCorner + &quot; and are still in!&quot;) . You chose corner number 2 and are still in! You chose corner number 1 and you&#39;re OUT .",

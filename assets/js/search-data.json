Intro to simulations describe what a simulation is from Collegeboard | how it is different from an experiment (ex. virtual vs. real life) | . | Show parking lot example and explain how the binary works (include learnings from binary lesson) | Present Hacks fixing rolling dice code | create something with binary? | answer questions about simulations | fill in the blank? | . | Lesson To-Do: . Intro to a simulation &lt;- similar to collegeboard (explain what it is and purpose/how it is different from an experiment) | Research the development of simulations | Rolling dice simulation as example? &lt; could be homework (more simple) | Design a simulation of a parking lot for lesson (use binary and each parking spot is represented by a bit) | Convert ideas into one programming language (Javascript?) | create a hw assignment (have students develop their own simulation? Creative freedom or pre-determined simulation? Debug/correct errors in a pre-made simulation?) | make a notes “template” in VS code (markdown) where students can fill in the blank &lt;part of intro and in teaching development | . Simulation To-Do: . explain notes to Sri and Ava (try to remember/make sense of notes) | create an HTML table | convert ideas into one programming language (javascript?) | start code with fixed numbers (example: 7,9,2,12) | make a for loop and nested for loop where it turns on an image (of a car) where the bit =1 | make a button that will generate 4 random numbers (random grid of cars 4x4 bits &lt;each row is a number represented by 4 bits) | test, test, test | create an explanation of code + explain use of simulation (basically speaker notes for lesson) | .",

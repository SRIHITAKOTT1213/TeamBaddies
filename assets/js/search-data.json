            "content": "3.16 Intro to Simulations - Alexa . What is a simulation? A simulation is an imitation of a situation or process | Aka a virtual experiment | . | . Guiding questions for a simulation: . - What makes it a simulation? - What are it’s advantages and disadvantages? - In your opinion, would an experiment be better in this situation? . Examples of Simulations: . Simulations are used all the time over many different industries . testing safety of a car | games | testing the efficiency of a parking lot | testing a new train route | . Simulation vs. Experiment . Experiment definition: procedure undertaken to make a discovery, test a hypothesis, or demonstrate a known fact | . So, why use a simulation? . Advantages: Can be safer | More cost-effective | More efficient | More data in less time | . | Disadvantages: Not as accurate as experiments | outside factors not included (ex: in rolling dice simulation gravity and air resistance) | . | When do you not use a simulation? when a situation already has set results/data (won&#39;t change) | examples: a score in a game, most purchased food, average yearly wage | . | . leads into real life game example: . A Real Life Example: Four Corners - Lydia &amp; Ava . an example of a simulation and experiment = the game of 4 corners | games are simulations! | We are going to play a round of 4 corners here in class. This game is a real life version of our simulation. | Mr. Mortensen will be the person in the middle choosing corners. | Everyone will choose a corner, and if your corner is chosen, you are out! | . | . The rules of the game: . a person stands in the center of a room and the 4 coners are labeled 1-4 | Every player chooses a corner while the person in the middle closes their eyes | person in the middle chooses/calls out a number when instructed | every player in the chosen corner is now out | contine until there is a winner! | Let&#39;s play! . Below is the simulation of the four corners game! . import random status = &quot;in&quot; while status != &quot;out&quot;: chooseCorner = input(&quot;What corner do you choose?&quot;) corner = random.randint(1,4) if int(chooseCorner) == corner: status = &quot;out&quot; print(&quot;You chose corner number &quot; + chooseCorner + &quot; and you&#39;re OUT&quot;) else: print(&quot;You chose corner number &quot; + chooseCorner + &quot; and are still in!&quot;) . You chose corner number 2 and are still in! You chose corner number 3 and are still in! You chose corner number 4 and you&#39;re OUT . Comparing Experiment to Simulation Code: . Mr. Mortensen (person in the middle) = random.randint | if statement = if player is out | else = safe/continue | while loop = repeats process until there is a winner of the game | . DEBRIEF QUESTIONS: . Why is it better to code simulations than experiement in real life? | What makes this game a simulation? | What are its advantages and disadvantages? | Would an experiment be better in this situation? (raise hands for each team) | Hack #1 - Alexa . Create an idea for a simulation and describe it (you don’t actually have to code it just think about/answer the guiding questions). | .

Below is a simulation of the Game of Life, originally written by John Horton Conway. Mr. Mortensen has this game on the APCSP site and we think that it is a great example of an interactive simulation. . What it is . This game is an unpredictable cellular automaton | automaton = imitates human life, hence why this is called the game of life | After creating the initial configuration, the game evolves without pattern | . How it works . Cells in this game are alive or dead, similar to binary where they are on or off | The user created an initial configuration of cells on the grid, and presses play (tap the squares on the grid) | a cells&#39;s status (alive or dead, on or off) depends on the surrounding 8 cells status (surrounding 8 cells). Here are the rules: The birth rule= a dead cell (non-) | . | . . Remix of Game of Life . start step Hack #3 . Describe the rolling dice simulation (answer guiding questions) | . Hack #4 . Add a feature onto the rolling dice simulation above ex: a 14-sided dice or expand the purpose of the simulation (hint: use conditionals to make dice part of a game/real life situation) | . | .
